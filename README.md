<h1>portofolio exercise</h1>
this one is from my early days of learning css so don't mind the bad design :)
<h2>About</h2>
this purpose of this exercise is that depending on the button you click,the photos from the title of the button will show.
<h3>Strategy</h3>
I chose 2 classes for each photo.1 is the common class between the photos and another for more specific detail.based on the 2nd class I categorized the photos and by JS I wrote a function to hide the other photos which are not included.
